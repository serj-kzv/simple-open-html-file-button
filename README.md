# simple-open-html-file-button
Simple button to open html files.
The extension was made due to lack of the functionality
in Firefox on some operating systems.  
You can use it to open HTML files in **Firefox on Android**.

**WARNING!** Because of
[Firefox bug #12731](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/12731)
and maybe some other Firefox bugs with tab memory clearing
all tabs including tabs that were opened with **Simple button to open html files**
extension may try to reload its content.
But in case of tabs that were opened with **Simple button to open html files**
it leads to full tab memory clearing.

# Installation
Use [Addons.mozilla.org (AMO)](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/simple-open-html-file-button/)
